You can download in UCSF ChimeraX.\n   Find your model on the Protein Data Bank and download in PDB Format (gz).    In case you haven’t yet, download and install ChimeraX (Free for private use and academic or research institutes).    Start ChimeraX and open the file (File -\u0026gt; Open).     Often, the model will contain additional chains or ligands. To remove the extra chains, do the following:   Select the chain you do not need (Select -\u0026gt; Chain), go to Actions -\u0026gt; Ribbon -\u0026gt; Hide.  If there are many extra chains, select the one you need (Select -\u0026gt; Chain), and then click on Select – Invert all models. This will select all chains besides the one you need. Then, go to Actions -\u0026gt; Ribbon -\u0026gt; Hide. For a ligand:  Even if you want to print the ligand as well, we still recommend removing as described above and printing it separately. Since there is normally (logically) a gap between ligand and molecule they should ideally be printed as separate objects. Remove the ligand by selecting the entire chain (Select -\u0026gt; Chain), then go to Actions -\u0026gt;Atoms/Bonds -\u0026gt; Hide.      Prepare the chain for 3D-printing: Most importantly, you need to make sure the structure is thick enough to survive printing.

Of the different types of DNA damage that arise in cells, single-strand breaks (SSBs) are the most common, arising at a frequency of tens of thousands per cell per day from direct attack by intracellular metabolites and from spontaneous DNA decay. Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are discontinuities in one strand of the DNA double helix and are usually accompanied by loss of a single nucleotide and by damaged 5- and/or 3-termini at the site of the break.   Double-strand break repair: Double-strand DNA breaks are common events in eukaryotic cells, and there are two major pathways for repairing them: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ).   Homologous recombination repair (HR) is a DNA repair process that includes the invasion of an undamaged DNA molecule by a damaged molecule of identical or very similar sequence. Resynthesis of the damaged region is accomplished using the undamaged molecule as a template.   Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as \u0026ldquo;non-homologous\u0026rdquo; because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template.

DNA consists of two chains of sugar, phosphate and four different bases. As the genetic information is incorporated in the arrangement of these bases, bases are combined firmly to mutually act as a template in order to maintain the arrangement. When DNA is irradiated, it may be partially damaged depending on the amount of radiation.\nDNA is small but very long The haploid human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA packaged into 23 chromosomes. Most cells in the body are diploid, with 23 pairs of chromosomes. That makes a total of 6 billion base pairs of DNA per cell. Because each base pair is around 0.34 nanometers long, each diploid cell contains about 2 meters of DNA. Moreover, the human body contains about 30 trillion cells—which works out to 60 trillion meters of DNA per human. Now, consider the fact that the Sun is 150 billion meters from Earth. This means that each of us has enough DNA to go from here to the Sun and back more than 200 times, or around Earth's equator 1.5 million times! What a tremendous project to packaging those DNA into 23 small chromosomes!\nDNA, Histones, and Chromatin We have to give credit to certain proteins for compact chromosomal DNA into the microscopic space of the eukaryotic nucleus. These proteins are called histones, and the resulting DNA-protein complex is called chromatin. Within the nucleus, histones provide the energy to fold DNA.\nHistones are a family of small, positively charged proteins termed H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. DNA is negatively charged, due to the phosphate groups in its phosphate-sugar backbone, so histones bind with DNA very tightly. As a result, chromatin can be packaged into a much smaller volume than DNA alone.\n\r\rhistone octamer\r\r\rBecause DNA wraps around histones, histones also play a important role in chromatin regulation and in the regulation of gene expression. A histone modification is a covalent post-translational modification (PTM) to histone proteins, which can impact gene expression by altering chromatin structure or recruiting histone modifiers. Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as transcriptional activation/inactivation, chromosome packaging, and DNA damage/repair.\nThe Unit of Chromatin:Nucleosome The basic repeating structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which contains eight histone proteins and about 146 base pairs of DNA. Today, researchers know that nucleosomes are structured as follows: Two each of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 come together to form a histone octamer, which binds and wraps approximately 1.7 turns of DNA, or about 146 base pairs. The addition of one H1 protein wraps another 20 base pairs, resulting in two full turns around the octamer, and forming a structure called a chromatosome. Every chromosome contains hundreds of thousands of nucleosomes, and these nucleosomes are joined by the DNA that runs between them.\n\r\rdiagram for nucleosome\r\r\r    Quiz of Repair pathways of DNA damages\r\rThis page has been viewed  times.\n","date":1642035000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642035000,"objectID":"1afb95157a804dd36e2899cf01156721","permalink":"http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/liangdai/post/dna-packaging-in-cell/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:50:00Z","relpermalink":"/liangdai/post/dna-packaging-in-cell/","section":"post","summary":"Cells have DNA, the blueprint of life.

It is originally stated as \u0026ldquo;DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein\u0026rdquo;.\nThe dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of sequence information between information-carrying biopolymers, in the most common or general case, in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein. There are 3 × 3 = 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these. The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3: three general transfers (believed to occur normally in most cells), three special transfers (known to occur, but only under specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and three unknown transfers (believed never to occur). The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), DNA information can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation). The special transfers describe: RNA being copied from RNA (RNA replication), DNA being synthesised using an RNA template (reverse transcription), and proteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template without the use of mRNA. The unknown transfers describe: a protein being copied from a protein, synthesis of RNA using the primary structure of a protein as a template, and DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a protein as a template - these are not thought to naturally occur.\nTable of the three classes of information transfer suggested by the dogma | General | Special | Unknown | | \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;| \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash; | \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;| | DNA → DNA | RNA → DNA |protein → DNA | | DNA → RNA | RNA → RNA |protein → RNA | |RNA → protein|\tDNA → protein|protein → protein |\nDNA Replication DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. -The first step in DNA replication is to ‘unzip’ the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. -Then a short piece of RNA called a primer comes along and binds to the end of two unzip strands continuously and discontinuously, respectively.\n Once all of the bases are matched up (A with T, C with G), an enzyme called exonuclease strips away the primers. And the new strand is proofread to make sure there are no mistakes in new DNA sequence. Finally, an enzyme called DNA ligase seals up the sequence of DNA into two continuous double strands. \r\rAn illustration to show replication of the leading and lagging strands of DNA. Image credit: Genome Research Limited\r\r\r  Transcription Transcription is the process by which the information in a strand of DNA is copied into a new molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). DNA safely and stably stores genetic material in the nuclei of cells as a reference, or template. Meanwhile, mRNA is comparable to a copy from a reference book because it carries the same information as DNA but is not used for long-term storage and can freely exit the nucleus.\n-Transcription is initiated by an enzyme called RNA polymerase and a number of accessory proteins called transcription factors, which form a complex called the transcription initiation complex. -Then, the RNA polymerase begins mRNA synthesis by matching complementary bases to the original DNA strand. -The mRNA molecule is elongated and once the strand is completely synthesized, transcription is terminated.\nThe newly formed mRNA copies of the gene then serve as blueprints for protein synthesis during the process of translation. \r\rAn illustration to show transcription of DNA.\r\r\rTranslation Translation is a process by which the genetic code contained within a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule is decoded to produce a specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.\nThe key components required for translation are mRNA, ribosomes, and transfer RNA (tRNA). \r\rtRNA featuring the anticodon, complementary to specific mRNA\r\r\rDuring translation, mRNA nucleotide bases are read as codons of three bases. Each ‘codon’ codes for a particular amino acid. Every tRNA molecule possesses an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon, and at the opposite end lies the attached amino acid. tRNA molecules are therefore responsible for bringing amino acids to the ribosome in the correct order ready for polypeptide assembly. \r\rDiagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosome\r\r\rPlease note that a single amino acid may be coded for by more than one codon.

These can occur in the form of numerical abnormalities (gains and losses) or structural abnormalities (deletions, inversions, and exchanges). Generally, chromosomal aberrations are going to be deleterious and lead to many genetic diseases. Numerical abnormalities can result in spontaneous abortions and severe birth defects. Structural abnormalities can lead to birth defects, cancer, and other late onset disease outcomes.\nDuplication Duplication mutation is gene sequence that is repeated several to hundreds of times. It can occur in normal chromosomes and may have adaptive advantages in fact. For example, useful mutations may occur in the copy of the original gene. Basically, the original gene provides a stable fallback, like a safety net, and the new gene can have mutations, like an experiment to express extra protein. Sometimes, the person who has duplication mutations can be completely unaffected.\n\rDeletion Deletion mutation results in the loss of some segment of a chromosome. Now, most deletion mutations are either lethal or will tend to cause serious disorders unlike the duplication mutation. For example, a disease called cri-du-chat is caused by the deletion mutation in the upper arm of chromosome 5. The deletion can lead to mental retardation and malformed larynx as well as obvious physical appearances.\n\rInversion Inversion mutation is a chromosome rearrangement in which a segment of a chromosome is reversed end-to-end. An inversion usually occurs when a single chromosome undergoes breakage and rearrangement within itself. It can lead to two potential issues: 1. The inversion may bring together genes that were not previously close to each other especially the regulatory regions of some genes, which could cause those genes turned on or off at the wrong time. 2. Any crossover of two genes due to inversion can lead to wrong productions of proteins related to these genes.\n\rTranslocation Chromosome translocation is a phenomenon that results in unusual rearrangement of chromosomes. It includes balanced and unbalanced translocation with two main types: reciprocal- and Robertsonian translocation. Most translocation is reciprocal. Reciprocal translocation is a chromosome abnormality caused by exchange of parts between non-homologous chromosomes. Two detached fragments of two different chromosomes are switched. The non-homologous chromosomes don’t have the same genes. Therefore, there is no conspecific information to exchange. The result is that one chromosome missing some material and the other chromosome now has added material. There are two potential problems associated with it. If the missing gene is critical, the individual who got the shorter chromosome (the top one in the diagram) will definitely have problems. Moreover, if the duplication of these genes is inappropriate, any individual carrying the longer chromosome (the bottom one in the diagram) will also be affected.\n\rAneuploidy and Polyploidy Another way to have abnormal chromosome is in the form of numbers. Aneuploidy is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, such as a human cell having 45 or 47 chromosomes instead of 46 ( Normally, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes). Any number above or below 46 will tend to be termed. It is one of the major causes of human reproductive failure. In most case, the miscarriage of a woman is because of aneuploidy. On the other hand, polyploidy is a kind of different situation where the cell does not have an extra one or two chromosomes but a duplication of every chromosome. For example, in polyploidy, these individuals have three or more of each type of chromosomes (3n or 4n) instead of having the usual 2n number like human do. In human, this condition is lethal. Most of these individuals die before birth.\n\rRing chromosomes \rChromatid Bridge \r  Quiz of Repair pathways of DNA damages\r\rThis page has been viewed  times.\n","date":1642034930,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642032000,"objectID":"78f3c102eded2967abc3d5911740d471","permalink":"http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/liangdai/post/chromosomal-aberration/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:48:50Z","relpermalink":"/liangdai/post/chromosomal-aberration/","section":"post","summary":"Chromosomal aberration, or chromosomal mutation, is a missing, extra, or irregular portion of chromosomal DNA.

The types of radiation fall into two main categories: particulate and electromagnetic.\n electromagnetic radiation consists of photons that have energy, but no mass or charge, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma radiation (γ).

Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron.\nIn 1923, Compton published a paper in the Physical Review that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to light quanta.

In the photoemission process, when an electron within some material absorbs the energy of a photon and acquires more energy than its binding energy, it is likely to be ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Moreover, the energy of the emitted electrons will not depend on the intensity of the incoming light of a given frequency, but only on the energy of the individual photons.\n\r\rSchematic of the experiment to demonstrate the photoelectric effect.

The measurement of absorbed dose is a complex problem due to scattering and absorption, and many specialist dosimeters are available for these measurements, and can cover applications in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D.\nIn radiation therapy, the amount of radiation applied varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated.

Double-strand breaks occur less frequently, at 0.04 locations per cell, which means that if 100 cells are evenly exposed to 1 mGy of X-rays, double-strand breaks occur in four cells.\nQuiz of Repair pathways of DNA damages\r\rThis page has been viewed  times.\n","date":1642034580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641948000,"objectID":"db196f8b65b024da89ada04265b1cd9c","permalink":"http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/liangdai/post/unit-of-radiation-dose/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:43:00Z","relpermalink":"/liangdai/post/unit-of-radiation-dose/","section":"post","summary":"Unit of Radiation Dose The gray (symbol: Gy) is a derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units (SI).

These are much too small to be seen under a microscope. cloud chamber is a particle detector used for visualizing the passage of ionizing radiation and was invented by an English physicist, C. T. R. Wilson, in 1911. It is an instrument designed for the study of the trails of radioactive emissions. It consists of a sealed environment containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol.\nAn energetic charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the gaseous mixture by knocking electrons off gas molecules via electrostatic forces during collisions, resulting in a trail of ionized gas particles. The resulting ions act as condensation centers around which a mist-like trail of small droplets form if the gas mixture is at the point of condensation. These droplets are visible as a \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo; track that persists for several seconds while the droplets fall through the vapor. These tracks have characteristic shapes. For example, an alpha particle track is thick and straight, while an electron track is wispy and shows more evidence of deflections by collisions.\n  ","date":1642034520,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641947459,"objectID":"b446cf9d27ce3b70662e6f7fb7948637","permalink":"http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/liangdai/post/radiation-detection-by-the-cloud-chamber/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:42:00Z","relpermalink":"/liangdai/post/radiation-detection-by-the-cloud-chamber/","section":"post","summary":"Cloud Chamber Radioactive elements continually undergo a process of radioactive decay during which their nuclei emit high-speed particles and rays.
